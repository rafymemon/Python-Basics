What we learn

1. Basic Class and object
Problem : Create a car class with attribute like brand and model. Then create an instance of this class
2. Class method and self
Problem : add a method to the Car class and displays the full name of the car(brand and model)

3. Inheritance
Problem : Create a ElectricCar class that inherit the car class and add a attribute battery_size
4. Encapsulation
Problem : Modify the car class to encapsulate the brand attribute, making it private and provide a getter method to it.
5. Polymorphism 
Problem : Demonstrate polymorphism by defining a model fuel_type in both car and ElectricCar, but with different behaviours
6. Class veriables
Problem : Add a class veriable to Car that keeps track of the number of cars created
7. Static method
Problem : Add a static method to the Car class that returns a general description of a car
8. Property decorators
Problem : Use a property decorator in the Car class to make the model attribute read only
9. Class inheritance and isinstance() function
Problem : Demonstrate the use of isinheritance() to check if my_tesla is an instance of Car and ElectricCar 
10. Multiple inheritance
Problem : Create two classes : Battery and Engine and let the ElectricCar inherite from both, demonstrating multiple inheritance
